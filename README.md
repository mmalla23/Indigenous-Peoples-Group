# History

The detailed history and surroundings of the Maasai people have informed their unique cultural traditions and values.[^1] The Maasai people originally occupied the Upper Nile Valley--in what is now Sudan-- in the 17th century CE. In search of better agricultural land, they migrated to Central East Asia in 1750 CE in what is now southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. Here, the 1,200,000 Maasai people are bounded by Lake Victoria to the west and Mt. Kilimanjaro to the East. They occupy 160,000 square kilometers of land in this area. Their culture was shaped in part by the Nilotic peoples, a group who had already been living in the central east Asian land prior to their arrival.

The Maasai people had been influenced by the Nilotic peoples’ physical characteristics and borrowed words from eastern Nilotic languages to develop their language, Maa. They adopted practices such as circumcision and genital cutting, both of which are required to be considered a full member of the tribe. Other traditions include the milk and meat ceremony, during which Maasai people must drink the blood of cows and kill a lion in order to be initiated into a higher warrior ranking, and the ceremony of fire marks that tests boys’ willpower by requiring them to run over hot coal. Maasai people operate under a patriarchal system in which male elders control the village and believe in the Enkai god. Cattle are of utmost importance to the Maasai people and are the source of value necessary to gain a higher social status. Though, this was not always the case; the drastic change in weather conditions that came with their move from Sudan to Kenya and Tanzania forced the Maasai group to abandon their agricultural plans. Instead, they shifted their focus towards stock-raising cattle and sheep.

# Treaties and Their Impact

The Maasai Agreement of 1904 is the most important treaty centered around this indigenous group. It is often called the Anglo-Maasai Treaty, but that is an incorrect name. In this treaty, the Maasai agreed to cease possession of pastures in the central rift valley in return for exclusive rights of two territories, Kajiado and Laikipia. 

<param ve-image label="Map of Territories" url="https://issafrica.s3.amazonaws.com/site/images/2021-11-03-kenya-county-map.png">

The background of this treaty starts with an influx of land for the Maasai people after the war of Iliokop, as they were struggling to control and occupy this new territory. Other tribes would infiltrate their land, ruining their agricultural and cattle advances. This began the period traditionally known as “The Disaster.” Disease ravaged the grazing land and cattle, and as a result the Maasai people raided neighboring tribes and groups. After this, the British East Africa rotectorate Government came into view, which for a short time worked together with the Maasai.

# Environmental Challenges

Climate change has caused the destruction of the Maasai’s property and threatened their cultural practices. For the past few years, the climate of Southern Kenya and Northern Tanzania has had an unprecedentedly long dry season, causing drought in Maasai tribal communities. The previous environmental conditions that cultural practices have been built around-- fertile land, long rainy seasons, and full rivers-- have allowed the Maasai people to thrive. Due to climate change, though, their cattle--a pillar of their livelihood-- become weak, do not produce milk, or even die. These environmental changes have posed life-threatening concerns that necessitate hunting for food which goes against their beliefs instead of drinking the milk and blood of their cattle. Without the help of action from the government, the Maasai people’s rich culture and traditions face extinction.

# Ongoing Human Rights Concerns

The Maasai people have been subjected to the human right violation of property theft through assimilation and relocation which has destroyed their ability to maintain their cultural practices. From the 1980s to today, the Maasai people have been displaced and dispossessed of their land due to the induction of wildlife conservation, national parks, and tourism that has been introduced. According to National Geographic, “The Maasai region has become a popular destination for safaris and wildlife tourism, bringing modest economic benefits to the area.” Currently more than 70,000 Maasai people are being relocated from their ancestral grazing lands to make way for these tourism hot spots, even paramilitary arrived in Loliondo in Arusha Region of Northern Tanzania to implement these eviction plans.

# Conclusion
Colonists’ and powerful governments' ignorance of environmental issues that most impact indigenous groups perpetuate an inescapable pattern of assimilation, relocation, and ethnocide.
