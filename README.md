# Thesis
The Maasai people have been subjected to the human right violation of property theft through assimilation and relocation which has eliminated their ability to maintain their cultural practices.


#History
The Maasai people originally occupied what is now Sudan in the 17th century CE. In search for better agricultural land, they migrated to Central East Asia in 1750 CE in what is now southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. Their culture was shaped in part by the Nilotic peoples, a group who had already been living on the central east asian land prior to their arrival. They adopted the practice of circumcision, borrowed words eastern Nilotic languages to use in their Maa language, and were influenced by the group’s physical characteristics. The drastic change in weather conditions from Sudan to Kenya and Tanzania forced the Maasai group to abandon their agricultural plans. Instead, they shifted their focus towards stock-raising cattle and sheep, which would come to play an important role in their livelihoods.

# Basic Facts


## Population Size

<param ve-image label="Map" url="http://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/a9cbd94e-916f-4976-85a0-dffc32788140/04ea984e-fa82-4e80-ab8b-def37bf6e09f.jpg">

It has been estimated that there are 1,200,000 Maasai people living in Kenya and Tanzania. It is important to note that many Maasai people doubt these numbers as some have been counted multiple times and other opt to not be counted.

“Please note that Most Maasai doubt these numbers. Many Maasai see the national census as government meddling and often miscount their numbers to census takers. Some people want to be counted ten times while others refused to be counted.”[^2]

## Language
Maasai people speak Maa, an eastern Nilotic language, in Southern Kenya and Northern Tanzania. 
## Religion
The monotheistic Maasai people believe in the god, Enkai, and that they are god’s chosen people.

# Treaties and Their Impact

The Maasai Agreement of 1904 is the most important treaty centered around this indigenous group. It is often called the Anglo-Maasai Treaty, but that is an incorrect name. In this treaty, the Maasai agreed to cease possession of pastures in the central rift valley in return for exclusive rights of two territories, Kajiado and Laikipia. 
The background of this treaty starts with an influx of land for the Maasai people after the war of Iliokop, as they were struggling to control and occupy this new territory. Other tribes would infiltrate their land, ruining their agricultural and cattle advances. This began the period traditionally known as “The Disaster.” Disease ravaged the grazing land and cattle, and as a result the Maasai people raided neighboring tribes and groups. After this, the British East Africa rotectorate Government came into view, which for a short time worked together with the Maasai. 


# Environmental Challenges
Before East Africa was colonized, the indigenous East Africans lived in harmony with the wildlife. But, as Europeans began dominating the area, indigenous Africans were forced to relocate so the Europeans could settle their rightful land.

“As conservationists establish East African national parks to preserve important ecosystems, they are actually trying to preserve East Africa under the tutelage of its native peoples: the Maasai, the Rendille, the Kikuyu...It is ironic, then, that one of the first steps in establishing a national park is to rid the region of its original caretakers.”
The Maasai people span many many different regions and are impacted by the establishment of national parks, as they are kicked off of their rightful land.
Maasai was frequented by drought, but not a problem until Europeans arrived, then they started sometimes hunting for necessity instead of just drinking milk and blood of cows
In 1891, the equilibrium was decimated and when the settler arrived, they believed they were setting on new wildlife, though this land belonged to the Maasai
Treaty mentioned above gave some land back, but grazing dry land still was stolen.
Very small cultural groups have been forced to extinction due to natural park development

# Ongoing Human Rights Concerns
Human rights being violated through assimilation and relocation, mentioned above 
“Human rights violations have been committed, including torture, illegal imprisonment, shooting and wounding people, killing and maiming livestock, destroying property, and forced evictions and land dispossession, despite vocal condemnation by the international community and numerous civil society organizations and coalitions.”
