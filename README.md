# Background/Historical Context

## Image

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]

## Map

The Maasai People are thought to have originated in the Upper Nile Valley. Since they have spread throughout southern areas of Kenya and northern areas of Tanzania (310 miles/500 kilometers north to south Maasailand). They are bounded by Lake Victoria to the west and Mt. Kilimanjaro to the East (180/300 kilometers miles east to west Maasailand). They occupy 160,000 square kilometers of land in this area.

# Basic Facts

## Population Size
It has been estimated that there are 1,200,000 Maasai people living in Kenya and Tanzania. It is important to note that many Maasai people doubt these numbers as some have been counted multiple times and other opt to not be counted. 

“Please note that Most Maasai doubt these numbers. Many Maasai see the national census as government meddling and often miscount their numbers to census takers. Some people want to be counted ten times while others refused to be counted.”[^2]

## Language
Maasai people speak Maa, an eastern Nilotic language, in Southern Kenya and Northern Tanzania. 
## Religion
The monotheistic Maasai people believe in the god, Enkai, and that they are god’s chosen people.

# Treaties
The Maasai Agreement of 1904 is the most important treaty centered around this indigenous group. It is often called the Anglo-Maasai Treaty, but that is an incorrect name. In this treaty, the Maasai agreed to ced possession of pastures in the central rift valley in return for exclusive rights of two territories, Kajiado and Laikipia.

The background of this treaty starts with an influx of land for the Maasai people after the war of Iliokop, as they were struggling to control and occupy this new terrotory. Other tribes would infiltrate their land, ruining their agricultural and cattle advances. This began the period traditionally known as “The Disaster.” Disease ravanged the grazing land and cattle, and as a result the Maasai people raided neighboring tribes and groups. After this, the British East Africa rotectorate Government came into view, which for a short time worked together with the Maasai.
